# IdeaHub_InternshipProject
Internship Project : Idea Hub - Team Mind Palace (Group 13)

**Idea Hub**
A centralized website where anyone within a company can post their innovative ideas.

**Vision:** A central hub to submit and view ideas within the company promoting innovation and collaboration. Individuals will be able to submit their ideas, and see if others may have similar ideas that they may already be working on. Ideas would be filterable by business area or space, as well a topic, skillset, etc.

**What Success Looks Like:** We will be successful if there is a high level of awareness within the company of ideas, and ideas being worked on along with who is championing them. We will be successful if we can quickly search and find ideas within business areas, or by topic, to see if someone else has a similar idea and may potentially be already working on it.
